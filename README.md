### Objective
The Head of Marketing seeks to identify the optimal Kenyan YouTubers for conducting marketing campaigns over the marketing period.

To create a dashboard that provides insights, we need a dataset of top Kenyan YouTubers in 2024 that includes
- Number of subscribers
- Total views
- Total videos
- Engagement metrics

#### User story
As the Head of Marketing, I want to use a dashboard that analyzes YouTube channelsâ€™ data in Kenya.
This dashboard should allow me to identify the top performing channels based on metrics like subscriber base and average views.
With this information, I can make more data-driven decisions about which Youtubers are right to collaborate with, and therefore maximize Return On Investment (ROI).

### Data source
We need a dataset containing columns;
-	Channel name
-	Subscribers
-	Total views
-	Total uploads
  
The data is sourced from [Social Blade](https://socialblade.com/youtube/top/country/ke). 
### Steps
